        <h3>My Failed Horizontal Webpage</h3>
        <p>
            Yesterday, I set out to level up my coding skills. What would I create today?
            I am basically a professional coder. I mean, I don't have a job, and I have very 
            few, if any, respectable looking material that I have created, but these are just
            small blips in the larger scheme of things. I have basically arrived. I decided 
            it would be a good learning experience to just whip up a quick horizontal scrolling
            layout. No big deal. (Example here: <a>https://www.igaming.studio/</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be plenty of time to assign blame later, but if I had to throw something
            out there off the top of my head, my failure started in completely neglecting to perform
            any meaningful research beforehand. In hindsight, this pains me. I'm sure every one 
            of my college professors would be crying. Who jumps straight into the work without proper
            research?
        </p>
        <p>
            Have I ever made a horizontal layout before? No.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have I ever even seen a horizontal layout? Um...like twice. Max.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pendejo.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I just jumped straight in. This should be pretty similar to making that 
            slideout navigation panel I did once. So I made a container div. I put three divs
            inside of it each taking up the full width of the screen. Only slide one was visible
            while the other two resided offscreen. I threw a quick background image onto each one
            in the most garish fashion that I could manage. An arrow absolutely positioned on each
            side of the screen would be placeholders to scroll horizontally until I implemented 
            that functionality. So basically, I have a giant slideshow I hope. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, I pulled up my javascript and added in my slides. I was hoping that with an event
            listener, I could create a function that used the absolute positioning to push the first
            slide off screen to be replaced with the second. I just couldn't seem to manage to get it 
            functioning though. It's true that sometimes Codepen doesn't function the way I hope (I 
            use Codepen when I have downtime at my job to keep me awake), but everything seemed to be 
            in proper order. Except, it didn't work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So I grabbed the width property and set it to zero on click and let the second slide come 
            to width: 100%. So on and so forth for each element with an if statement. I clicked the 
            button and slide one slid off to the left just as intended and slide two appeared. However, 
            though my code appeared the same for each, it would not turn to slide three. I know this is 
            user error, but I only had like ten lines of code and I swear, for the life of me, I could 
            not find the error in my code. How was one section working, but not another?
        </p>
        <p>
            Final resort. It looked like a slideshow already anyway. I'll make a carousel! I have made a 
            carousel before so I actually DID manage to get a functional carousel implemented that 
            allowed me to slide between things with my arrow buttons. But they wouldn't slide off the 
            so I made a keyframes animation that used absolute positioning to slide to the right off 
            screen. Only problem: it wasn't one continuous object scrolling along. So disappointing.
            I hate leaving projects completely broken, so I just changed the animation to an opacity 
            change so it is just another giant carousel. I hate it.
        </p>
        <p>
            What did I learn in code today?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well. I sat down googled horizontal webpages and their implementation. I quickly found an 
            article on completely CSS implementation and some on javascript implementation. Upon reading,
            I found that horizontal websites are not super easy to implement. The simplest implementation 
            was actually the CSS one that just rotated the entire container and then rotated the elements
            within back to the right orientation. However, this leads to some other issues the author 
            explains. I am not even going to try to explain the whole process, but suffice it to say
        </p>
        <p>
            1. I bit off more than I could chew. This project was outside of my abilities. Not because I 
            am not capable of learning, but because...
        </p>
        <p>
            2. I failed to do the proper research. One of the biggest things about coding that I learn and 
            relearn is that I don't have to reinvent the wheel. The beauty of this field is that web 
            developers have at their fingertips the whole internet. Had I done my research, I could have made
            a proper plan. I would have likely implemented the simple CSS method just to get my feet wet. It
            doesn't have to be perfect - it is not going into production for anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, next time I decide to make something I have never made before, I want to do 
            better research before I ever open my code editor. I can't get back my hours that I wasted 
            trying to implement this, but I can hope to avoid failing so hard on future projects. I will
            attempt to start smaller. I didn't need to make a whole webpage, I should have done a smallscale.
            I hope I will do better next time.
        </p>
        <h3>Until next time. Ciao!</h3>
